# Fibonacci-Computation
How Fibonacci is created, what formula it uses to work, and computing the largest Fibonacci number in 1 second using different algorithms and formulas

Currently a work in progress document. Focusing currently on Linear Reccurence and Closed-Form Solution.

Future plans include Fourier Transform (DFT and FFT), Galois Theory, Karatsuba, and maybe 1 more.

Current results: [Linear Reccurence: 254,487th Fibonacci Number] [Closed-Form Solution: 3,643,532 Fibonacci Number]
