Project list from "Understanding Fibonacci"

Add the python source code, explain what the code does
Clarify why Closed-Form Solution is faster than Linear Reccurence
Mention other algorithms such as FFT, DFT, Karatsuba, Binet and Galios theory
try to add SIMD
Use the video as help and a reference
don't make it too long nor complex

1/27/2025:
Explain Time Complexity and Space Complextiy (at the end)
Add Space-Optimized Iterations, Generators, Fast Doubling and Matric Exponentiation.
Start using FFT and adding Discrete additions into our code
Fix fulctuations
try other methods and start research on the new topics.
